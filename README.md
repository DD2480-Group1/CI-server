## Commit Structure for assignment-2

Each commit message should consist of a subject and a body. Please follow this message structure when committing to the project:

**Subject**

* The first line (the title) is the subject and should contain imperative language, present tense: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug".
* The subject should also start with a capital letter, not end on a period and be less than fifty characters.
* Prefix is not required as long as the subject summarizes the change itself.

After the subject, a blank line should be made followed by the body.

**Body**

* The body should also use imperative language: "Fix missing" instead of "Fixed missing" or "Fixes missing".
* When possible, use punctuation and capital letters where appropriate.
* Lines should not exceed 72 characters, except when including compiler error messages.
* Can include multiple paragraphs seperated by new lines.
* Try to always link to an issue, but if it is a really small change, it is not required.
* Any references to issues should be in the last paragraph, and use prefix like "Fixes", Closes" or "Resolves". See [GitHub Keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) for more details.
* Use "Fixes" for bugs and "Closes" for general issues.

Here is an example of a good commit:

```
Add missing import of 'gtest' in src/decide.cpp

decide/src/decide.cpp wont compile since the 'gtest',
dependency is not found.

Fix introduced by adding 'gtest' module to CMakeList.txt.

Fixes #1002
Closes #64
```
